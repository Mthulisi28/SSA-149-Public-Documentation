# PROJECT 1: SSA-149 SOVEREIGN NODE
PROBLEM: 15% Operational leakage due to human latency.
ACTION: Deployed deterministic SSA-149 logic gates.
RESULT: 100% Latency reduction; 30-day autonomous cycle.

# PROJECT 2: INTEGRITY AUDIT
PROBLEM: 5% Net settlement loss from logic gaps.
ACTION: Developed diagnostic scripts for real-time monitoring.
RESULT: Zero unauthorized errors; 5% revenue recovery.
